# Welcome to my Data Science Projects

## Folders
- Kaggle: Projects based on datasets present in Kaggle.
- Self_Projects: Projects picked up based on some ideas or interest.

## Difficulty Scales
- VeryEasy: Completed in a matter of a couple of hours. Datasets are likely to have been already prepared. Simple ML models to directly get effective results.

- Easy: Taken anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of days. Datasets may have already have been prepared or scraped from different sources. ML models are likely to have been straightforward.

-Medium: Projects that took anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Data took some effort to find and scrape from different sources. ML models may or may not have been straightforward.

-Hard: Projects that took more than a week. Requries intensive data wrangling, preparation, cleaning. Use of heavy EDA to understand relationship between features. Several ML models to try and improve evaluation metrics.
